            <ul>
              <li>Created new week work logs and work blog pages. Updated navs and necessary other pages to reflect additions.</li>
              <li>Changed some titles for headers and buttons on site, globally</li>
              <li>Read a bit more of <i>Functional-Light JavaScript ch 03: Managing Function Inputs</i> & did practice work with fat-arrow functions, ternary operator, and nested fat-arrow functions.</li>
              <li>Re-did some stuff on resume.</li>
              <li>Read the first three chapters of <i>Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming: ch 01 Whatever Are We Doing?, ch 02 First Class Functions, ch 03 Pure Happiness with Pure Functions</i> and did some practice work to help concrete theory and use.</li>
              <li>Read <i>Node.js The Right Way: ch 01: Getting Started</i> and first half of <i>ch 02: Wrangling the File System</i> and practiced a bit with files and fs</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Read a bit more of <i>Node.js The Right Way - ch 02: Wrangling the File System</i>, but stopped to look for a different book. This book suffers from the "foundations cookbook curse", similar to Kyle Simpson's books, where it gives you a lot of fun recipes, but never actually goes into what is going on behind the scenes, theory, or adequately specified semantics.</i></li>
              <li>Spent a long while looking for a better Node book, but wasn't able to find anything worthwhile. All books were either almost exclusively environment focused with almost no discussion of modules, outdated, or very heavy tutorial and code snippet based, with little discussion on semantics, theory, and environment processes. Decided to stick with current book, but while also reading other sources online to try and get a more in depth education and complete picture.</li>
              <li>Read about Node.js

            <p><b class="study-day">Day 03 - 01-09-18</b> - 6 hrs, 14 mins</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Updated week 10 Work page code to reflect switch changes in trading program to functional JavaScript</li>
              <li>Read <i>Functional-Light JavaScript ch 04: Currying</i> & did some more practice work with currying and partial application.</li>
              <li>Read <i>Functional-Light JavaScript ch 05: Coding by Composing</i> and did practice work with composition.</li>
              <li>Ran entire site through spellchecking and corrected spelling errors.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b class="study-day">Day 04 - 01-10-18</b> - 3 hrs, 43 mins</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Interview schedule for Tuesday. Reviewed various front-end interview question sample sets online. Was pleasantly compentant. Reviewed first 12 pages of past JavaScript notes. Started making notecards from existing notes to review prior to interview.</li>
            </ul>

        <article id="W13D05">
            <p><b class="study-day">Day 05 - 01-12-18</b> - 8 hrs, 17 mins</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Went through JavaScript notes &#40;32 pages, 10 pt font&#41; and made notecards to cover main topics, as well as finer details, to review in order to be fully versed on more niche questions.</li>
              <li>Spent rest of day reviewing notecards, as well as finding JavaScript interview questions to practice online. Front-end interview questions were suprisingly similiar to back-end questions I'd done in the past &#40;print the nth fibonacci number, etc.&#41;</li>
