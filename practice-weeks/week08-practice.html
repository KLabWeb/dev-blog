      <h2>A Group Data Structure</h2>

      <article class="description" id="desc-group">
          <p>JavaScript comes with a variety of nifty built-in data structure objects, with the array prototype being the most well know. In addition to indexed collections, there are also multiple key collection objects, such Map and Set. While Map holds key value pairs, set lacks keys and instead only allows uniquely valued objects &#40;no duplicate values&#41;.</p>

          <p>Here is a basic re-creation of Set I made &#40;named Group&#41; with functions add&#40;&#41;, delete&#40;&#41;, and has&#40;&#41; &#40;to check if a value is present&#41;. I also implemented a from&#40;&#41; method, to allow the creation of a Group by passing in an existing iterable object. Lastly, I implemented the Symbol.itertor interface, to make the data structure iterable, and allow methods such as for...of to be called on it.</p>

           <p>Here is an example demonstrating this. First, two strings are declared, both with the value \"first\". Then, two Symbols are declared. Like the Strings, for their optional description argument, they both take \"first\".</p>

      <h2>Flatten a Multi-Dimensional Array</h2>

      <article class="" id="desc-flatten">
          <p>Core JavaScript provides a series of helpful methods for collections to help manage them. Even the Object object has some very useful methods, such as Object.keys&#40;&#41;, which returns an array of all the property names for an Object, and Object.values&#40;&#41;, which returns all values of properties for an object.</p>

          <p>It should thus be no surprise that iterable objects such as Map, Array, and even String would also include a variety of such helpful methods. Here I take a multi-dimensional array and flatten it using Array.prototype.reduce() and Array.prototype.concat() to concatenate a multi-dimensional array into a 1D array. The reduce() method takes in a function and an initial value, then runs the function on each array element, computing and returning a single output, which is computed on top of the passed initial value.

          <p>For each index of multiArry, the 1D array, flatArray, and the inner array for the current index are passed in to a function. This function returns flatArray, but with the current index concatenated to it. The initial value passed in for flat array is an empty array.</p>

      <h2>High-Order Functions</h2>

      <article class="high-order" id="desc-high-order">
          <p>Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as parameters or returning them, are called high-order functions. By using high order functions, one is able to take a complex problem, and solve it in a more elegant and less wordy manner. This is done by breaking it down into smaller parts, whose duties can be delegated to individual functions, which can then be called on by the high order function&#40;s&#41;. This not only creates more concise code, but promotes proper encapsulation, more flexible and re-usable code, and can help create functions of higher purity with less side effects.</p>

          <p>Here I build a high-order function, which takes a value, then for each call, runs a test function, displays the current status via a body function, then updates via an update function. By encapsulating the test, display, and update steps into separate functions, I am able to create a main high-order function that is widely diverse in use, based on the varying conditionals, updates, etc. the parameter functions may compute.<p>

        <h2>Prototypes &amp; this</h2>

        <article class="" id="desc-this-prototype">
            <p>Classes are a new addition to JavaScript as of ES6. Already they have come to quick use, in frameworks and libraries, such as REACT. The original methodology for JavaScript's implementation of object oriented programming comes from prototypes. In the prototyping methodology, all objects have prototypes, where the prototype is the root version of the object. Some of the main prototypes include Object.prototype, Function.prototype, and Array.prototype.</p>

            <p>While the new java class functionality allows <i>extends</i> functionality similar to the traditional structured approach of languages like Java or C#, prototyping works a bit differently. Instead of instances, each object created as an offshoot from a prototype is actually a clone of that prototype. As expected, these clones gain the methods and properties of their prototype object. The clones can then override or add functionality without affecting the prototype. If the prototype changes, however, the clones will also reflect the changes. If a request for a property is made on a clone and it does not have it, the prototype will also be checked and it's value returned instead, if present.</p>

            <p><i>this</i> is often a source of confusion. What exactly does <i>this</i> reference? In short, what <i>this</i> references changes based on invocation location. If made within a method call, <i>this</i> references the object that is executing the current function. If made within a global function call, <i>this</i> references the global object (ex. browser window). When declaring a property within a class that one wishes to be referenced easily from outside of a class, that property could be declared via <i>this</i>.propertyName.</p>

            <p>Here is a quick example showing a taste of these concepts:<p>
