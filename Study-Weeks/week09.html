          <p><b class="study-day">Start of Month Three Check-In</b></p>
        <p>Two months in. Feel confident about HTML and CSS. Excited to reach parsing and front-end interaction. Want to learn about web scraping, where I am running analysis on properties of objects, such as geolocation. Planning on waiting to apply to start of new year. Enjoying studying. Learning a lot fast. <strong>Dec plans:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>JavaScript Reading: 2-4 hrs daily</strong></li>
          <li><strong>HTML + CSS + JS Projects & Book Practice: 3-5 hrs daily</strong> - Dynamic subsection of the site with at least a few pages with small SPA. JSON & REST APIs. Parsing in data pulled from dynamic sites that are constantly generates data, analysis of data, and interactive frontend access to with charts, graphs, etc.. Smaller challenges until I get into DOM manipulation, JSON, etc.. Substitution of Lain project with startup site work if work available. Set up VPS CentOS sever &amp; self host.</li>
          <li><strong>Python 101, REACT: 3-5 hrs daily</strong> - Read through the first half &#40;250 pages&#41; of <i>Python Crash Course.</i> Do quick coding exercises, but don't spend longer amounts on complex problems. Read through REACT docs &amp; experiment with it some. After finish quick read of <i>Crash Course</i>, go back and read it slower, taking notes. Do more complex exercises and practice. Will be pretty deep into JS then. Interactive site with single-page application using HTML, CSS, JS, Python, REACT, REST APIs, persistant data, analysis. Would be cool is SPA had optional CLI.</li>
          <li><strong>Falcon: burst</strong> - Once I get basic Python, do a couple bursts on the Falcon docs. Experiment with it some. Gives preference to compiling via Cpy. Rest API. Fast access to data calls via library.</li>
        </ul>

              <li>Starting experimenting with JavaScript DOM interaction on Week 09 Practice sandbox. First, a grasp on how JS interacts with the DOM, and through what interfaces it uses.

              <li>Added to week 09 sandbox page by porting elements from week 07, week 04, and week 04, restyled to fit the layout a bit, then modified page to be fully responsive for varying viewport sizes.</li>
