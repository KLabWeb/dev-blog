            <h3>EXPERTISE</h3>
          </header>
          <div>
            <p id="pe">I've been painting since a young age as a student garzone to Andrea del Verrocchio. Since then, I have spent much time and effort protecting my craft, especially my drawings and paintings. I believe a painter should begin every canvas with a wash of black, because all things in nature are dark except where exposed by the light.</p>
            <h2>The noblest pleasure<br>is the joy<br>of understanding</h2>
            <p id="px">I also specialize in invention, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, writing, history, and cartography. The acquisition of knowledge is always of use to the intellect, because it may thus drive out useless things and retain the good. For nothing can be loved or hated unless it is first known</p>

            <h3>Augustinians of San Donato</h3>
            <p>Oil on Wood<br>1481</p>
            <p>I painted <em>The Adoration of the Magi</em> as a commission for the Augustine monks in San Donato. The ruins are depicted are a a reference to the Basilica of Maxentius. They dominate a preparatory perspective and include the fighting horsemen. This painting was later used as an inspiration for Domenico Ghirlandaio.</p>

            <h3>Monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie </h3>
            <p>Mural<br>1481</p>
            <p>For <em>The Last Supper</em> I sought a greater detail and luminosity than could be achieved with traditional fresco. I thus painted this on a dry wall rather than on wet plaster. I then added an undercoat of white lead to enhance the brightness. This painting is one of the world's most recognizable paintings</p>

            <h3>Piero Soderini</h3>
            <p>Pencil Cartoon<br>1503 - 1504</p>
            <p><em> The Battle of Cascina</em> depicts Florentine soldiers bathing naked in the river Arno responding to a trumpet which warns them of the sudden Pisan attack. One soldier has been hit and fallen back into the river, while others leap energetically into action. It walls the Salone dei Cinquecento in Palazzo Vecchio.</p>
