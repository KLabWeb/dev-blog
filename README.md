This site is an ongoing project to build my knowledge on new web languages, frameworks, tools, etc.. It exists partly for personal time tracking and study roadmap planning. It also exists to host projects, code snippets, and exercise work. The more I learn, the more diverse, styled, responsive, interactive, and functional the site becomes. So far I have built on it with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES9), and React. Practice work is ordered chronologically to show progression easier.

My coming primary focus will be on React (alpha, with hooks) in much greater detail, react-router, redux, functional JavaScript, and GraphQL.
