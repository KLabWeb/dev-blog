This site was built log my studies for personal time tracking, as well as to plan out future work. It also exists to host sample and practice snippets and projects. The further I get in my web dev studies (front and back end), the more diverse, styled, responsive, interactive, and functional the site will become. Practice work is ordered chronologically to show progression easier. 

This site contains a mixture of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6), React, and other languages, mixed across various small projects, apps, and exercises.
