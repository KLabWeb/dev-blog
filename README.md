This site is an ongoing project to build and demonstrate my knowledge, education, and experiences in new languages, frameworks, libraries, paradigms, design patterns, and architecture principles. It exists partly for personal time tracking and study roadmap planning. It also exists to host larger projects, code snippets, notes, education resources, and smaller programming challenges. The more I learn, the more diverse, styled, responsive, interactive, loosely coupled, re-usable, and feature rich the site and components in it become. So far I have built on it with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Python, PHP, MySQL, jQuery, DataTables, and Hover.css, with an Nginx web server securely hosted on Debian. Practice work is ordered chronologically to demonstrate progression easier.

Current focuses include heavy studies and practice project with object oriented design patterns and software architecture design, Laravel, Python, and React Hooks, as well as more practice in stateless function programming. Planned following work includes Django, MariaDB, and more specialized tools and libraries, like Redis for Caching, Lumen for API design and development, Ramda.js for functional programming, and Docker, for compartmentalized, fast-to-deploy development environments.

Most other projects on my Github are also hosted on this blog.
